# Writing Programs! That Write Other Programs!!

> Why write programs when you can write a program to write programs for you? And
> that program writes programs that are faster than the programs you’d write by
> hand. And that program’s programs are actually, you know, correct. Wow!
>
> Yep, it’s time to synthesize. But this ain’t Moog, this is program
> synthesis. What is that, and how can it upgrade our optimizers into
> super-optimizers? We’ll find out!!
